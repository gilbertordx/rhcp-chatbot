# Chapter 4: Development Guidelines and Documentation Standards

This chapter provides instructions for the ongoing development of the RHCP Chatbot, emphasizing adherence to the established implementation plan and the concurrent generation of comprehensive project documentation.

## 4.1 Primary Goal

The overarching goal is to systematically execute the tasks outlined in the project's implementation plans (refer to Chapter 3 and Chapter 5) and, in parallel, to produce thorough documentation covering both the development process and the resulting codebase.

## 4.2 Documentation Requirements

As development progresses through the phases and tasks detailed in the implementation plans, the following documentation artifacts must be created and diligently maintained:

1.  **Implementation Summary (`IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md`):**
    *   A Markdown file dedicated to documenting the implementation and any migration processes.
    *   For each completed development phase (commencing from Phase 2 onwards), this document must summarize:
        *   The main objectives of the phase.
        *   Key design decisions made.
        *   Significant changes implemented.
        *   Any challenges encountered and their resolutions.
        *   A high-level overview of code modifications and additions.

2.  **Implementation Steps Log (Covered by `Chapter_2_Development_Log.md`):**
    *   This requirement is fulfilled by `Chapter_2_Development_Log.md`, which serves as a detailed, step-by-step chronological record of development activities.
    *   It includes: files modified/created, specific code changes with rationale, commands executed, testing performed with results, and debugging steps.

3.  **New Code Documentation (`CODE_DOCUMENTATION.md` or Integrated Documentation):**
    *   All new or significantly modified code must be documented.
    *   This can be achieved through:
        *   A dedicated Markdown file (`CODE_DOCUMENTATION.md`) explaining the purpose, functionality, and usage of new modules, classes, or functions.
        *   Alternatively, or in conjunction, documentation integrated directly into the code using comments (e.g., JSDoc for JavaScript) where appropriate.
    *   The documentation should focus on explaining the *rationale* behind code design, its inputs, outputs, and any side effects.

Adherence to these documentation standards throughout the implementation process will ensure the creation of a valuable resource for understanding the project's evolution, design choices, and codebase.
