# Chapter 6: High-Level Development Roadmap

This chapter presents a high-level, phased roadmap for transforming the RHCP Chatbot project into a fully functional, advanced, and deployable specialized chatbot. It outlines the general progression of development efforts.

---

## 6.1 Phase 1: Foundational Setup & Core AI/ML Logic

**Objective:** To establish a minimal end-to-end chatbot capable of processing messages and providing basic responses using existing data.

**Key Steps:**

1.  Verify project setup and dependencies.
2.  Implement core Natural Language Understanding (NLU) logic using the `natural` library:
    *   Load and prepare training data (`base-corpus.json`, `rhcp-corpus.json`).
    *   Set up and train an intent classifier.
    *   Implement intent identification from user messages.
3.  Implement basic Response Generation logic, mapping intents to corpus answers or simple facts from static data (`band-info.json`, `discography.json`).
4.  Update the `processMessage` function to utilize NLU and Response Generation components.
5.  Implement the basic Express.js server and the `/api/chat` endpoint.

## 6.2 Phase 2: Knowledge Base Integration & Enhanced Responses

**Objective:** To enable the chatbot to answer questions using structured data, moving beyond predefined corpus answers.

**Key Steps:**

1.  Refine entity extraction within the NLU pipeline (e.g., band members, album names, song titles).
2.  Modify Response Generation to query loaded static data based on intent and extracted entities.
3.  Generate more dynamic and informative responses using data-populated templates.

## 6.3 Phase 3: Database Integration

**Objective:** To migrate static and potentially training data to PostgreSQL for improved organization, scalability, and manageability, particularly for a planned admin panel.

**Key Steps:**

1.  Define Sequelize models for band information, discography, and potentially training data/intents.
2.  Write and execute database migrations to create necessary tables.
3.  Create or refine a seeding script (e.g., `src/scripts/seed.js`) to populate the database from JSON files.
4.  Update NLU and Response Generation components to fetch data from PostgreSQL.

## 6.4 Phase 4: Additional Feature Implementation

**Objective:** To add user authentication, authorization, and potentially commence work on an admin panel.

**Key Steps:**

1.  Implement user registration and login API endpoints.
2.  Implement JWT-based authentication middleware.
3.  Secure API endpoints requiring authentication (e.g., chat history, admin functions).
4.  Begin development of backend routes and logic for the admin panel (e.g., managing knowledge base entries).

## 6.5 Phase 5: Testing, Refinement, and Optimization

**Objective:** To improve the chatbot's performance, accuracy, and robustness.

**Key Steps:**

1.  Develop unit and integration tests for NLU, response generation, API, and database interactions.
2.  Implement comprehensive error handling and logging.
3.  Monitor chatbot performance and response quality.
4.  Explore opportunities for NLU/NLG improvements (e.g., alternative libraries, techniques, advanced models).
5.  Refine training data and responses based on testing and feedback.

## 6.6 Phase 6: Deployment Preparation

**Objective:** To prepare the application for deployment.

**Key Steps:**

1.  Review and finalize the `Dockerfile`.
2.  Ensure correct handling of environment variables.
3.  Add necessary production configurations.
4.  Develop clear deployment instructions.

This roadmap provides a strategic overview of the development lifecycle, complementing the more detailed plans in previous chapters.
