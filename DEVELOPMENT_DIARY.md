# Development Diary - RHCP Chatbot

## 2023-10-27 (Recap of Progress to Date)

**Objective:** Summarize key development milestones and the current state of the RHCP Chatbot project.

**Tasks Completed:**

*   **Initial Setup & Refactoring:**
    *   Set up an Express.js server (`src/app.js`).
    *   Loaded training data (`base-corpus.json`, `rhcp-corpus.json`) and static data (`band-info.json`, `discography.json`).
    *   Implemented initial NLU using `natural.BayesClassifier`, later switched to `natural.LogisticRegressionClassifier`.
    *   Created `ChatbotProcessor` for core message handling.
    *   Refactored the application into a modular structure:
        *   `src/initializer.js`: Manages data loading, classifier training, and `ChatbotProcessor` instantiation.
        *   `src/http/controllers/chatController.js`: Orchestrates message processing.
        *   `src/http/routes/chatRoutes.js`: Defines the `/api/chat` Express route.
        *   `src/app.js`: Focuses on server setup and delegates initialization and routing.
*   **NLU Tuning Attempts:**
    *   Refined utterances in `rhcp-corpus.json` to improve distinction between `band.members` and `member.biography`.
    *   Implemented a confidence threshold in `chatbotProcessor.js` (experimented with 0.6, 0.8).
    *   Switched classifier from `natural.BayesClassifier` to `natural.LogisticRegressionClassifier`.
    *   Observed persistent misclassifications for specific queries ("Who are the members of the band?", out-of-scope queries) even after these changes.
*   **Automated Testing Framework (Phase 5 Initiation):**
    *   Installed Jest as a dev dependency.
    *   Added a "test" script to `package.json`.
    *   Created `test/chatbotProcessor.test.js` with initial test cases.
    *   Failures in tests for problematic queries confirmed NLU limitations.
    *   Modified `chatbotProcessor.js` to log classification details when `NODE_ENV=test` for better analysis.
*   **System Documentation:**
    *   Generated `SYSTEM_OVERVIEW.md` detailing system architecture and workflow. (This was later noted as deleted in the user provided context, will need to regenerate or confirm its status).

**Current Status & Next Steps:**

The project is currently facing challenges with the NLU component's accuracy for certain types of queries. The immediate priority, as outlined in `REFINED_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`, is **Phase 2A: NLU Enhancement & Iterative Testing**.

## 2023-10-27 (Current Task)

**Phase:** 2A - NLU Enhancement & Iterative Testing

**Objective:** Systematically address current NLU misclassifications and significantly improve overall NLU accuracy, robustness, and out-of-scope detection.

**Current Sub-Task (2A.1):** Training Data Augmentation & Refinement
*   **Action:** Begin a thorough review of `rhcp-corpus.json` and `base-corpus.json` for ambiguities, overlaps, and gaps, paying close attention to problematic intents like `band.members`, `member.biography`, and `greetings.hello`.
*   **Update (2023-10-27):**
    *   Refined utterances for `member.biography` in `src/data/training/rhcp-corpus.json` by removing ambiguous phrases and adding more specific examples.
    *   Augmented `greetings.hello` and `intent.outofscope` in `src/data/training/base-corpus.json` with additional diverse utterances.
    *   Re-ran Jest automated tests (`npm test` with `NODE_ENV=test`).
    *   **All tests passed.** Key improvements observed in classification logs:
        *   "Hello": Correctly classified as `greetings.hello` with confidence **0.9818** (previously 0.585, below threshold).
        *   "Who are the members of the band?": Correctly classified as `band.members` with confidence **0.9963** (previously misclassified as `member.biography`).
        *   "Tell me about quantum physics": Correctly classified as `intent.outofscope` with confidence **0.9977** (previously misclassified as `agent.acquaintance`).
    *   The NLU refinement significantly improved accuracy for the previously problematic queries.

**Next Sub-Task (2A.2):** Commit NLU Improvements & Iteration
*   **Action:** Commit the successful NLU changes to the repository.
