- 'Multi-turn Conversations' are (a thing) really cool, interesting.
-  if i ask for a full documentation of the code, he does it in a epic way. i didnt write any of that, but it took only
a few seconds, and theres a big documentation of HOW IT WORKS, which i can learn from.
- he even has a built (in terminal, so i can run commands inside the editor.) in terminal, and he also runs
the commands, i just watch and learn lol. crazy! feels super cyberpunk.
(- he has a built in git terminal, so i can commit, push, pull, etc.)
